Batch import-export application, user manual

Version 29.6.2019. Written by Ossi Mäntylahti, Terra Colligo

Batch import-export application is used to export and import Odoo products in a batch. The program addresses several shortcomings that Odoo's basic product import-export functionality lacks. Key features are following:

- The program supports more than 500 lines. To bypass this restriction, the application breaks import in several max 500 lines batches and the processes all of them.
- Updating quantities of products. Odoo's basic import-export does not support setting quantities. This one does. To set up quantity, write the number in corresponding warehouse column
- Add or set logic. When importing products, the operator can set logic for either adding or setting the quantities.
- Mass-archiving. See use instructions below.
- Exporting active and archived products
- Set product image. See instructions below
- Set category. See instructions below

== Required permissions == 

Batch import-export products is intended to be used by system administrator.

To import products one has to edit user permissions and allow
"Import Product & Inventory" setting in user permissions.
1. Enable developer mode
2. Navigate to Settings / Manage Access rights / <user> / edit
Under Technical Settings
select 
Import Product & Inventory permission for the user

Relogin to activate new permissions

== Mass archiving use ==

To archive products in a batch the operator has to do following:
1. Set archive value in the imported Excel file to 1
2. Select either "Archive" or "Archive and rename" when importing the products

Only products that correspond with already existing products in the database, whose Archive flag is set to 1 will be archived (or renamed and archived). If both values are not true, then the product is ignored.

== Set product image use ==
Batch Import-export program supports setting the product images. To set a product image, fill in a publicly available URL in the image_medium
 field and import the excel. Dropbox is a good source. Image can be for example:
 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tfbwd6rtgvqxxh7/AACiF4-hox3z0LSx8czt6bhNa?dl=0&preview=07.png

If the image_media field is empty, the import routine will ignore it

If the image media has keyword DELETE in it, the import routine will empty the product image

== Set category usage ==
Batch Import-Export routine also supports setting catgories and Sub-categories.

Separation between sub-categories is determined by " / " string (space, slash, space)

Product category names can contain slash character. But no space and slash.

Categories can be for example

Clothes
	Women
		Shirts
		Dresses
	Men
		Jeans
		Shirts

In category import the item for a woman's dress is determined as
Clothes / Women / Dresses

Respectively Men's shirt is determined as 
Clothes / Men / Shirts

If Batch Import-Export does not found already existing category, it will create it.
